# Medical Diagnosis Assistance

---

## Project Overview

### Introduction
Welcome to the Medical Diagnosis Assistance project! This project aims to develop AI tools that assist doctors in diagnosing diseases by analyzing medical images and patient data. By leveraging advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, these tools can provide accurate and timely diagnoses, aiding medical professionals in making informed decisions and improving patient outcomes.

### Key Features
- **Image Analysis**: Analyze medical images (X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, etc.) to detect abnormalities and diagnose diseases.
- **Patient Data Analysis**: Integrate and analyze patient data (medical history, lab results, etc.) to provide comprehensive diagnostic insights.
- **Prediction and Recommendation**: Offer predictive insights and treatment recommendations based on the analysis.
- **Visualization**: Visualize analysis results with annotated images and charts for easy interpretation.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with existing hospital information systems (HIS) and electronic health records (EHR).
